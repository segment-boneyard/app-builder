# app-builder

  A component build command for our subapps, so that we don't have to repeat our configuration everywhere, and so that minification and other settings are handled automatically when the `NODE_ENV` is `"production"`.

## Installation
  
    $ npm install segmentio/app-builder

## Example

    $ ./node_modules/app-builder/.bin/app-builder
